It takes a Merkle proof (an array of hashes), the expected Merkle root, the specific leaf data, and the leaf's original index within the tree. It iteratively reconstructs the hash path from the leaf upwards by combining the current hash with elements from the proof array, using `keccak256` and adjusting the concatenation order based on the index's parity. The function returns `true` if the final computed hash matches the provided Merkle root, indicating a valid proof that the leaf is part of the tree represented by the root, and `false` otherwise. As a `pure` function, it does not modify contract state, making it inherently low risk from an operational standpoint.", "key_terms_operations": ["Merkle proof verification", "keccak256", "abi.encodePacked", "Merkle root", "Leaf", "Proof element", "Index parity check (index % 2)", "Index division (index / 2)", "public pure returns (bool)"]}
