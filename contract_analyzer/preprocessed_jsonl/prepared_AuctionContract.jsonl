Subsequently, the caller becomes the new `highestBidder` and their bid becomes the new `highestBid`. The primary risk lies in the use of `transfer()` for refunds, which has a fixed gas limit of 2300. If the `highestBidder` is a smart contract whose fallback/receive function requires more than 2300 gas, the `transfer()` call will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert.
